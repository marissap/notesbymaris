A confidence interval gives an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter. The level of a confidence interval (in percentage) gives the probability that our true value lies in the interval.

The selection of a confidence level expresses the probability of how likely it is to find the true value in the confidence interval. Common values choosen are 0.90, 0.95, and 0.99.

Formula for CI:
