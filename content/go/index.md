### Introduction
When I first started as a developer I chose to compliment my formal university education with languages, tools, and frameworks that are not taught in class but are broadely used in the workplace. Therefore, the Java, OOP, and UML diagrams I was learning, applicable primarily to backend and Android development, and Python, applicable to automation (we weren't taught libraries and application to data science and ML) was best complimented by frontend technologies.

I therefore chose to pursure profeciency in HTML/CSS, vanilla JS, then frameworks like React and Vue, static site generators like Gatsby, the DOM, http/https, etc. I do find this work enjoyable. Being able to create a UI that engages users and simplifies the task is quite rewarding. However, after spending time in the workplace working on the backend of a system with Java and interaction with a database and other systems, I was intrigued by some more systems/network based technologies.

I was hearing increasingly more about Golang within the developer community and decided that was the way to go. I had no experience of C/C++ so an imperative programming language seemed like a excellent additional understanding to have. 

### The Basics
[Golang.org](https://golang.ord) was my first resource and it did not disapoint. The interactive learning platform has you go step by step through the main features of Go, building on top of each module before it, and allowing you to solve practice questions in the browser with each feature introduction. The first noticable difference between my experience and Go was the installation and setup process. It is much more explicit than setting up Python (which even comes preinstalled on mac).

#### Concurrency
The main feature of Go is concurrency. At first read one might assume concurrency and parallel programming are similar or even the same. Concurrent programs can run in parallel, but they don’t have to. The main benefit of concurrent programs is their ability to break up executions into different, independent tasks. These different tasks are run on different execution threads which are stopped and started in synchronization with all the others. It allows you to explicitly structure the execution of your program and pass data between different tasks.

### The Project
I think it is consensous that the best way to learn is to code. Therefore, solidfying my new knowledge into a legitmate project was the next step in my Go journey. After much thought I decided on implementing a CLI program. I often forget commands in the CLI— is it `gatsby develop` or `gatsby start`

### Conclusion
I think there are two main reasions I came to easily love Go. 1) The comphrehensive docs and 2) the robust, structural, explicit nature of the language.
