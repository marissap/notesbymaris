This October marked my first dive into open source and I gotta say, I'm a fan.

I'd always liked the idea of it, collective development seemed so different from the competition of proprietary software and to me, I always thought open source would produce better software. Mostly because you're engaged with a wide variety of developers with different strengths but also, its open for any stakeholder to explore and suggest improvements. Collectively we can produce more responsive, better tailored, and more interesting software.

I've wanted to participate in Hacktoberfest for awhile but was intimidated. But this year, I'm feeling more like a developer. I've worked a year in total as a real software developer and while I'm still a computer science student, I was really fortunate to work in organization's that didn't treat me like it. So I'm kind of at this place where I'm feeling more comfortable (not quite there) with calling myself a developer!!

Anyway, so it seemed like the right time to dive in. And oh boy was it great. I discovered some incredibly unqiue and innovate projects which while I was not ready to contribute to, I'm now following and will hopefully be able to lend a hand soon. My greatest achievement though, I got a non-trivial pull request merged!!! I added a new page to a projects website that lists contributors to the project (technical and non-technical) and was able to design it!! (I like making things look pretty).

This is getting long and I like to keep this blog short so to wrap things up, Hacktoberfest is great for introducing people to open source, people are creating some truly creative, democratic tech with open source, and the developer community is very welcoming to newcomers. Thank you Digital Ocean and DEV.to for this year's Hactoberfest and thank you everyone who merged my pull requests.
