On Wednesday October 9 I held my first workshop for the STEAM (STEM + Arts) club on campus of which I am the VP Finance.

It went... amazing! The week before I desiged and coded a CSS Animation of the Big Dipper. You can check it out on codepen [here](https://codepen.io/marissap/pen/wvwbMyr).

The workshop was advertised as requiring no programming experience so I knew I would have to explain the basics and build up. I prepared a little the day before, wrote some notes of what I wanted to discuss but when I went in, I never referenced it. I had coded the animation, I knew how to do it, I taught myself web development so I know what complete newbies need to know, so I spoke from experience. It allowed to make random jokes, ask questions of the attendees, walk around and help people out if they were stuck, just in general keep it chill. It was great. I left on a high. Coding is awesome and so is sharing that with others.üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª‚ú®

I will edit this blog post and add pictures from event once I have them!

*I became interested in CSS Art because of [this](https://dev.to/aspittel/learning-css-through-creating-art-54c0) talk by the incredible [Ali Spittel](https://www.alispit.tel/).*
