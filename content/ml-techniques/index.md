#####Regression/Estimation 
- predicting a continuous value, for example, predicting things like the price of a house based on its characteristics, or to estimate the Co2 emission from a car’s engine.

#####Classification 
- predicting the class or category of a case, for example, if a cell is benign or malignant, or whether or not a customer will churn. 

#####Clustering 
- grouping similar cases, for example, can find similar patients, or can be used for customer segmentation in the banking field.

#####Association 
- finding items or events that often co-occur, for example, grocery items that are usually bought together by a particular customer. 

#####Anomaly detection
- discover abnormal and unusual cases, for example, it is used for credit card fraud detection.

#####Sequence mining 
- predicting the next event, for instance, the click-stream in websites.

#####Dimension reduction
- reduce the size of data. 

#####Recommendation systems
- this associates people's preferences with others who have similar tastes, and recommends new items to them, such as books or movies.
