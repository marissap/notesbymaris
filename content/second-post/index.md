- Lowers costs for consumers, extra money is spent in domestic economy
- Reshuffles job from different industries but quality of jobs differ 
- Depends on demand, interest rate, exchange rate, political stability
- When dollar appreciates, cheaper for consumers to import and exports are more expensive
- When dollar depreciates, each dollar gets less powerful, imports get expensive, exports cheaper
- Balance of payments
    - Current account
        - Investment income, sale and purchase, foreign aid
    - Financial/capital account
        - Stocks and bonds
        - Selling assets to pay for imports 
            - US does this, they mean to run trade deficit
