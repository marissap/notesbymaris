###Supervised
Loads the model with knowledge so that we can have it predict future instances. The model is trained by data from a __labeled__ dataset. There are two types—Classification and Regression.
- __Classification__ is the process of predicting a discrete class label, or category. 
- __Regression__ is the process of predicting a continuous value as opposed to predicting a categorical value

###Unsupervised
The model is trained on an unlabed dataset and draws conclusions. These are more difficult algorithms than supervised learning since we know little to no information about the data. There are four types.
- __Dimension reduction__: Reducing redundant features
- __Density estimation__: Finding structure
- __Market basket analysis__: If you buy a certain group of items, you're more likely to buy another group of item
-  __Clustering__: Grouping data points based on similarities
