#####Supervised
- Load the model with knowledge so that we can have it predict future instances, we teach the model by training it with some data from a labeled dataset
- Classification and Regression
    - Classification is the process of predicting a discrete class label, or category. 
    - Regression is the process of predicting a continuous value as opposed to predicting a categorical value

#####Unsupervised
- Trains on the dataset, and draws conclusions on unlabeled data
- More difficult algorithms than supervised learning since we know little to no information about the data
- Dimension reduction
    - Reducing redundant features
- Density estimation
    - Finding structure
- Market basket analysis
    -  if you buy a certain group of items, you're more likely to buy another group of item
-  Clustering
    - Grouping data points based on similarities
